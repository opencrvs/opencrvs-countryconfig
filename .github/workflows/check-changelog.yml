            Oops! Looks like you forgot to update the changelog.
            When updating CHANGELOG.md, please consider the following:
              - Changelog is read by country implementors who might not always be familiar with all technical details of OpenCRVS. Keep language high-level, user friendly and avoid technical references to internals.
              - Answer "What's new?", "Why was the change made?" and "Why should I care?" for each change.
              - If it's a breaking change, include a migration guide answering "What do I need to do to upgrade?".
