/**
 * Handler for event registration confirmation.
 *
 * This function is called when an event registration is initiated and demonstrates
 * how to implement an action confirmation handler for the REGISTER action type.
 *
 * Action confirmation handlers support three response patterns:
 *
 * - HTTP 200: Immediately accept the action. For registration actions, the response
 *   must include a registrationNumber in the payload: { registrationNumber: "..." }
 *
 * - HTTP 400: Immediately reject the action. The action will be marked as rejected.
 *
 * - HTTP 202: Defer the decision (asynchronous flow). The action enters a 'Requested' state
 *   until it is later explicitly accepted or rejected. When using this approach, you must
 *   store the token, actionId, eventId and action payload to use with the accept/reject API calls later.
 *
 * For registration actions specifically, when accepting asynchronously, you must provide
 * a registration number as shown in the acceptRequestedRegistration example below.
 *
 * @param {ActionConfirmationRequest} request - The request object.
 * @param {Hapi.ResponseToolkit} h - The response toolkit.
 * @returns {Hapi.Response} The response object. Should return HTTP 200, 202 or 400. With HTTP 200, the payload should contain the generated registration number.
