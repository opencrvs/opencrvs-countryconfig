/**
 * Handler for event registration confirmation.
 *
 * This function is called when an event registration is initiated and demonstrates
 * how to implement an action confirmation handler for the REGISTER action type.
 *
 * Action confirmation handlers support three response patterns:
 *
 * - HTTP 200: Immediately accept the action. For registration actions, the response
 *   must include a registrationNumber in the payload: { registrationNumber: "..." }
 *
 * - HTTP 400: Immediately reject the action. The action will be marked as rejected.
 *
 * - HTTP 202: Defer the decision (asynchronous flow). The action enters a 'Requested' state
 *   until it is later explicitly accepted or rejected. When using this approach, you must
 *   store the token, actionId, eventId and action payload to use with the accept/reject API calls later.
 *
 * For registration actions specifically, when accepting asynchronously, you must provide
 * a registration number as shown in the acceptRequestedRegistration example below.
 *
 * @param {ActionConfirmationRequest} request - The request object.
 * @param {Hapi.ResponseToolkit} h - The response toolkit.
 * @returns {Hapi.Response} The response object. Should return HTTP 200, 202 or 400. With HTTP 200, the payload should contain the generated registration number.

  // OPTION 1: Immediate acceptance (HTTP 200)
  // Return HTTP 200 with a registration number to immediately accept the registration action.
  // This is the default implementation that automatically generates and assigns a registration number.

  return h
    .response({ registrationNumber: generateRegistrationNumber() })
    .code(200)

  // OPTION 2: Immediate rejection (HTTP 400)
  // To reject the registration immediately, uncomment the following:
  //
  // return h.response({ reason: 'Rejection reason here' }).code(400)

  // OPTION 3: Deferred decision (HTTP 202)
  // To implement an asynchronous workflow where the decision is made later:
  // 1. Store the token, eventId, actionId, and action details in your system
  // 2. Return HTTP 202 to place the action in 'Requested' state
  // 3. Later call client.event.actions.register.accept.mutate() or client.event.actions.register.reject.mutate()
  //
  // Below is example of how to defer the confirmation, accepting it after a 10 second delay
  // To defer the confirmation, uncomment the following:
  //
  // setTimeout(() => {
  //   acceptRequestedRegistration(token, eventId, actionId, action)
  // }, 10000)
  // return h.response().code(202)
