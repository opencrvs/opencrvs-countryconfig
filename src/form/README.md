### Data types

We are using some data types and they maintain a hierarchical relation between themselves. These types are currently defined in `/packages/client/src/forms/index.ts`

1.  **`IForm:`** IForm lies in the highest level in the hierarchy of form field definitions. It has an array of `IFormSection` in the sections property. For instance, `registerForm.birth` is an `IForm`.

2.  **`IFormSection:`** `IFormSection` holds all the field definitions of a corresponding `section`. A form has several sections and they are important for structuring form data. The sections are ordered in accordance with a visual representation. So, they play an important role in both the data and the view layer of the form. An `IFormSection` has several properties.
    > Note: Question mark beside the property means it is optional, otherwise the property is mandatory.

- 1.  **`id:`** Unique identifier of a section within a `IForm`. Usually it indicates the property where all section data should consist when submitting. It can also be named otherwise with the help of a section-wise mapping.

* 2.  **`viewType:`** `viewType` describes whether the form should be represented as a form input or only view (in our case, RegisterForm / CollectorForm or ReviewForm / PreviewForm). It has four possible values: form, review, preview and hidden.
* 3.  **`title:`** Title shown above the form section.
* 4.  **`optional?:`** A section can be optional. It indicates whether a section is optional or not.
* 5.  **`name:`** It is used to hold the title of the corresponding tab if the section has any.
* 6.  **`groups:`** Consists of an array of groups. A group is used as a view group for fields and displays a part of a section. It only has presentational significance and no impact on section data. Groups have a type of `IFormSectionGroup`.
* 7.  **`mapping?:`** Stands for section-wise mapping and has a type of `IFormSectionMapping`. More will be discussed in the mapping section.
* 8.  **`disabled?:`** Indicates whether the section is disabled or not.
* 9.  DEPRECATED: **`hasDocumentSection?:`** It tells whether the section has a corresponding document section or not.
* 10. **`notice?:`** Used to display a warning text under the label.

3.  **`IFormSectionGroup:`** As earlier mentioned, a group is used as a view group of fields and shows a part of a section. A group is visually equivalent to a partial section. It holds field definitions of that part of the section. So, a section does not have fields as its direct children rather it has to have groups that contain several fields as direct children. It also has some features like `previewGroup`, conditionals. An `IFormSectionGroup` has id as its unique identifier. It has a property named fields in which an array of IFormField is provided. Actually, IFormField is a union of all fields. That means any field is an IFormField; it can be TEXT, TEL, RADIO_GROUP, etc. IFormField inherits IFormFieldBase type.

    It has a `preventContinueIfError` prop. It has the boolean value true users cannot get past this view group with a validation error or left out a required field. This group consists of several fields which are mentioned below.

4.  **`IFormFieldBase:`** This type is the base type of all fields. That means any property of this type is applicable to all fields. It has the following properties.

- 1.  **`name:`** Identifier of the field. Typically unique for one group but sometimes it is okay to have a group that can have fields having the same names if they do not appear at the same time.
- 2.  **`type:`** Input type of the field. It can be TEXT, SELECT_WITH_OPTIONS, etc.
- 3.  **`label:`** The label for the input field.
- 4.  **`tooltip?:`** Tooltip text for the field.
- 5.  **`validate:`** This prop holds an array of validator function references from the codebase. A reference is just an object with the operation and optional parameters prop. That means the field value is processed through that function and gives errors if validation fails.
- 6.  **`required?:`** If the field is required then set this to true. So, when the field is left unfilled, it gives a validation error.
- 7.  **`prefix?:`** When there is a text to show at the start of input, this prop is used.
- 8.  **`postfix?:`** It is used when there is a text to show at the end of the input. For instance, for taking input of a person’s weight we have to show the unit, which is one of the use cases where postfix can be applied.
- 9.  **`disabled?:`** The field is disabled when it is set to true.
- 10. **`initialValue?:`** When the field requires a value during generation before input, this prop is used.
- 11. **`extraValue?:`** Actually this property is needed when we need more information for mapping/ tracking with the original value of the field. Currently, we are using it in the document field, nested field and reasons not applying fields. The reasons for extraValue is like:

      Suppose we need to upload a national id doc for mother/father but we have only the value like `national_id`. How could we track whose dock is this? So we need to pass an `extraValue` like mother father/vice-versa with the field itself so the corresponding mapping could recognize whose document this is.

      For `nestedFields` with `nestedRadioFieldTransformer` mapping, we need to pass `optionValue` as `extraValue` to recognize which option is selected. The reason is as all the options in `nestedField` are processed during the mutation mapping so we need to stop processing other options that are not selected.

      The same sort of logic for reasons fields also because we need to know who is not applying for what. That is why we need to pass father/mother/etc as `extraValue`.

- 12. **`conditionals?:`** It keeps an array of `IConditionals`. `IConditional` is an object where it has a prop named expression which is a text containing a [javascript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators). The condition lies in that expression. It is evaluated (with eval) when rendering the fields and conditionally shows/hides the field.
- 13. **`description?:`** Description text to show under the label.
- 14. **`placeholder?:`** Placeholder text for the input.
- 15. **`mapping?:`** It contains an object of `IFormFieldMapping` type. As the name goes, the property does the job of mapping data when submission (mutation) and retrieval (query) at field level. The reason for the mapping function is that the format of the data in graphql is different than the format of the form and the data of the form needs to be transformed. It has two properties: query and mutation.

  - **`query:`** Name of the `query` transformer method in operation property.

  - **`mutation:`** Name of the `mutation` transformer method in operation property.

- 17. **`hideAsterisk?:`** Required fields always show a red asterisk. This prop hides the asterisk even if the field is required.
- 18. **`hideHeader?:`** It hides the label. It can be used when a group has only one field and we want to show the group title only.
- 19. **`mode?:`** This prop indicates theme mode. The container component where the input field is implemented may be in a dark or light theme. This property enables theme mode to be passed to the field to adapt styles accordingly.
- 20. **`hidden?:`** This property is set to `true` if we want the field to be hidden.
- 21. **`previewGroup?:`** This prop takes the id of the preview group. An `IFormSectionGroup` can have multiple preview groups in its `previewGroups` property. Each preview group object has its respective ids.
- 22. **`nestedFields?:`** This field accepts an object map of field arrays that and the keys of the object are all possible values of that field. That means nested fields appear below the field when the corresponding key is the value of the field.
- 23. **`hideValueInPreview?:`** Hides the value on the review page.
- 24. **`ignoreBottomMargin?:`** If we need to remove space between any 2 fields then we need to set this prop value to `true` in the first field. If there are 3 fields we need to set the value to `true` in the first two fields. Actually it set value fields bottom margin to `0px` if set to `true`.
- 25. **`readonly?:`** If this is set `true`, users cannot change its value in the review page.
- 26. **`hideInPreview?:`** Setting this property true hides this field in the review page, although the value still persists in the form data.
- 27. **`ignoreNestedFieldWrappingInPreview?:`** If it is set to `true`, it ignores nested field wrapping when transforming the value.
- 28. **`ignoreFieldLabelOnErrorMessage?:`** It is set to `true`, the fields of a preview group do not show their respective error messages if they have, they show a collective error message instead.
- 29. **`reviewOverrides?:`** This block of configuration is used if we want display a field from one section with another section on the review section. This only affects the review screen, not the section pages view. This configuration consists of total 8 proiperties.
  - **`residingSection:`** ID of the section the field actually belongs to.
  - **`reference:`** This is basically the location where we want the field to appear on the review screen. Reference object consist of `sectionID`, `groupID`, `fieldName`.
  - **`position:`** Optional property, the value of `position` should be either `before` or `after`. It decides either our element appears before the reference element of after.
  - **`labelAs:`** An optional propoerty, Just incase we want to change the label as well.
  - **`conditionals:`** Optional property. Same as any other condition, but this condition applies should the element be displayed on the new location or not. It satisfied it will be displayed to the new location other wise it not change it's location.

### Properties of default.ts

Going through all properties of default.ts below

### registerForm

This object has all the form definitions of corresponding events i.e. birth, death. This object only applies for event declaration forms.

### birth

This object holds sections for birth declaration forms. All sections are contained in sections prop. The sections are ordered as shown below.

1.  ### `registration`
    The registration section has several groups as listed below.

- #### `informant-relation`

  It is a conditional group and it is only visible when someone else is applying for birth (in other words, `presentAtBirthRegistration` equals “OTHER” in draft). This condition is defined in the conditional prop.

  - #### `informant`

    This field has a type of `RADIO_GROUP_WITH_NESTED_FIELDS`. It has a property size and its value large makes it appear bigger than the regular radio option. Similar to radio group but it has an additional feature that shows or hides nested input fields upon selected radio option. The map of the fields against selected values is defined in nestedFields property. For instance, for selected value `OTHER_FAMILY_MEMBER` or `OTHER` it has an array of fields and `otherRelationShip` is the only member of the array. For other selected options as there are no fields to show, they have an empty array on the map.

    - OTHER_FAMILY_MEMBER -> **`otherRelationShip`**

      This is a text input field. This field value is filled up when the informant has any other relationship with the child in the family but not in the provided options. This field value is mapped to `informant.otherRelationShip` in graphql. Having a look at `changeHirerchyMutationTransformer` (for mutation) and `changeHirerchyQueryTransformer` (for query) which are mentioned in the mapping prop will help to get the idea of how the field value gets transformed to graphql payload.

    - OTHER -> **`otherRelationShip`**

      This field is applicable when the informant has any other relationship with the child outside the family. This field also maps to `informant.otherRelationShip` in graphql. The transformation methods are defined in the mapping prop for both query and mutation.

- #### `primary-informant`

  This is also a conditional view group of fields which is visible only when the informant is both parents (`presentAtBirthRegistration` equals “`BOTH_PARENTS`” in draft). The purpose of this group is to choose the primary informant between both parents. It has two fields under it.

  - #### `informant`
    This is also a radio group with nested fields. It has only two options (`MOTHER` and `FATHER`) which indicates the primary informant. It maps to `informant.relationship` in graphql.

- #### `contact-view-group`

  This view group is intended for deciding the contact point of the declaration. The contact point of the declaration means the person who will be notified when the birth registration has been sent for review or registered. The fields under this view group are mentioned below.

  - #### `contactPoint`

    This is a radio group with nested fields. It has some conditional options. When the informant is a legal guardian (the user selects option `LEGAL_GUARDIAN` in the [informant](#informant) field), the options only `INFORMANT`, `OTHER` are displayed. If the informant is one of the parents (the user selects `MOTHER` or `FATHER` in the [informant](#informant) field), the options `MOTHER`, `FATHER` and `OTHER` displayed. If the informant is anyone else, all options are displayed (`INFORMANT`, `MOTHER`, `FATHER`, `OTHER`). All these conditions are defined in conditional prop in respective options. This field maps to registration.contact in graphql. The nested fields after selecting each option is described below.

    - INFORMANT -> **`registrationPhone`**

      When the informant is a legal guardian or anyone other than the parents and contact point is selected to the informant, the `registrationPhone` field is displayed to take input of the phone number. It maps to `registration.contactPhoneNumber` in graphql.

    - MOTHER -> **`registrationPhone`**

      When the primary contact point is `MOTHER`, the field shows up. It also maps to registration.contactPhoneNumber in graphql.

    - FATHER -> **`registrationPhone`**

      When the primary contact point is `FATHER`, the field shows up. It also maps to `registration.contactPhoneNumber`.

    - OTHER -> **`contactRelationshipOther`**

      When the primary contact point is anyone other than the informant or parent, to keep a record of relationship, this text input appears. Maps to `registration.contactRelationshipOther` in graphql.

    - OTHER -> **`registrationPhone`**

      When the primary contact point is another person, below `contactRelationshipOther` field, this `registrationPhone` is shown. As like before, it also maps to `registration.contactPhoneNumber` in graphql.
