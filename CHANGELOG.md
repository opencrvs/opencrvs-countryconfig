# Changelog

## 1.6.4

### Bug fixes

- Query the location tree directly from the config service to improve performance for large datasets

## 1.6.3

### Breaking changes

- Add constant.humanName to allow countries to customise the format of the full name in the sytem for `sytem users` and `citizens` e.g `{LastName} {MiddleName} {Firstname}`, in any case where one of the name is not provided e.g no `MiddleName`, we'll simply render e.g `{LastName} {FirstName}` without any extra spaces if that's the order set in `country-config`. [#6830](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6830)

## 1.6.2

## 1.6.1

### Bug fixes

- We make sure that the automatic cleanup job only runs before deployment (instead of cron schedule cleanup).
- Previously it was possible MongoDB replica set and users were left randomly uninitialised after a deployment. MongoDB initialisation container now retries on failure.
- On some machines 'file' utility was not preinstalled causing provision to fail. We now install the utility if it doesn't exist.

## 1.6.0

### Breaking changes

- **Notification Flags** The configuration of various notifications is now controlled from `countryconfig` instead of being handled in the UI, as notification settings are not something that should be changed on the fly. To simplify this process, we have moved the settings to the `application-config.ts` file. From now on, the notifications can be managed in the `notificationForRecord` object defined in the mentioned file. Any changes will take effect after a new deployment.

  **_Country implementors must define the `notificationForRecord` object in the `application-config.ts` file to enable the notifications they want. Not doing so will keep notifications disabled by default._**

- **Gateways searchEvents API updated** `operationHistories` only returns `operationType` & `operatedOn` due to the other fields being unused in OpenCRVS
- **Config changes to review/preview and signatures** Core used to provide review/preview section by default which are now removed and need to be provided from countryconfig. The signature field definitions (e.g. informant signature, bride signature etc.) were hard coded in core which also have now been removed. The signatures can now be added through the review/preview sections defined in countryconfig just like any other field. You can use the following section definition as the default which is without any additional fields. We highly recommend checking out our reference country repository which has the signature fields in it's review/preview sections

```
{
  id: 'preview',
  viewType: 'preview',
  name: {
    defaultMessage: 'Preview',
    description: 'Form section name for Preview',
    id: 'register.form.section.preview.name'
  },
  title: {
    defaultMessage: 'Preview',
    description: 'Form section title for Preview',
    id: 'register.form.section.preview.title'
  },
  groups: [
    {
      id: 'preview-view-group',
      fields: []
    }
  ]
}
```

- Remove `splitView` option from DOCUMENT_UPLOADER_WITH_OPTION field
- New required sections preview & review added. Signature field definitions are now part of these two sections same as normal form fields.
- Remove `inputFieldWidth` from Number type form field
- You can now configure the home screen applicationâ€™s name and icons in your country configuration package as manifest.json and app icon files are moved from core to country config (check `src/client-static` folder)
- Updated `allowedFileFormats` in signature fields to use MIME types (`image/png`, `image/jpg`, `image/jpeg`, `image/svg`) instead of simple file extensions. If you are already using the `allowedFileFormats` field in your implementation, please ensure to update the format accordingly.
- Remove unnecessary UI dividers that add in various sections of the declaration forms(e.g the Death, Birth and Marriage forms) [#244](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/244)
- The details exists conditionals for the various sections i.e. father, mother, spouse has to use the `values.detailsExist` property instead of accessing it from `draftData.[sectionName].detailsExists`. This is due to the fact that the draftData is not populated until any changes have been made to any of the fields in the current section.

### Bug fixes

- Protect individual certificate endpoint with token
- Kibana disk space alerts now work regardless of your disk device names. Alerts listen devices mounted both to `/` and `/data` (encrypted data partition)
- "Publish release" pipeline now correctly uses the "Branch to build from" value as the branch to be tagged. Previously it tried tagging "master". "Release tag" is also now used as the release version as is instead of it being read from `package.json`.
- Environment creator script now requires countries to provide a Github token with no expiry date. This is to reduce effort in keeping the token up to date.
- Added the missing outputs for the clear environment workflow which was causing the seed data workflow to not run even if the reset option was checked when deploying

### New features

- The select options in DOCUMENT_UPLOADER_WITH_OPTION field can now be hidden using the new `optionCondition` property. It works similarly to the same property available in SELECT_WITH_OPTIONS field

* **ElasticSearch reindexing** Allows reindexing ElasticSearch via a new search-service endpoint `reindex`. We're replacing the original `ocrvs` index with timestamped ones. This is done automatically when upgrading and migrating, but this is an important architectural change that should be noted. More details in [#7033](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/pull/7033).

- Introduce a new certificate handlebar "preview" which can be used to conditionally render some svg element when previewing the certificate e.g. background image similar to security paper

- **Notification flags**: Added notification flags for `BIRTH`, `DEATH`, and `MARRIAGE` events, including:

  - `sent-notification`
  - `sent-notification-for-review`
  - `sent-for-approval`
  - `registered`
  - `sent-for-updates`

- **`/record-notification` API**: Endpoint to check enabled notifications for records. The API returns the `notificationForRecord` object for `BIRTH` and `DEATH` events, listing their respective flags. Route configuration includes description and tags for API documentation.

### New content keys requiring translation

```
INSERT CSV ROWS IN ENGLISH ONLY
```

## Bug fixes

- Github pipeline dedicated for reading secrets and variables from other environments now checks if GH_TOKEN is still valid before attempting other operations
- Remove unnecessary UI dividers that add in various sections of the declaration forms(e.g the Death, Birth and Marriage forms) [#244](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/244)
- Update template transformer for fields `informantType` and `otherInformantType` that fixes the bug of unavailability of these template fields [#5952](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/5952)
- Fixed missing InitialValue property to set initial values based on an expression

## 1.5.2 (https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.5.1...v1.5.2)

## Bug fixes

- Broken email alerts from low disk space are now fixed [293](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/293)

## 1.5.0 (https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.4.1...v1.5.0)

### Breaking changes

- #### Update the certificate preview mechanism

  In effort of minimizing JavaScript-bundle size, we have streamlined the way how review certificate -page renders certificates. In case the images in your certificates are previewing blurry, you need to update your SVG-certificates to print QR-codes and other images directly with `<image width="36" height="36" xlink:href="{{qrCode}}" x="500" y="770"></image>` instead of the more complicated `<rect fill="url(#pattern)"></rect>` -paradigm. This doesn't affect printed certificates as they are still created as previously.

- #### Application config items `DATE_OF_BIRTH_UNKNOWN` and `INFORMANT_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` moved under `FEATURES`

  See https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/pull/1005 for details

### Infrastructure

- Allow using staging to both period restore of production backup and also for backing up its own data to a different location using `backup_server_remote_target_directory` and `backup_server_remote_source_directory` ansible variables. This use case is mostly meant for OpenCRVS team internal use.

- Automate SSH key exchange between application and backup server. For staging servers, automatically fetch production backup encryption key if periodic restore is enabled

- Improved support for non-22 SSH port

- Treat backup host identically to other hosts. To migrate:

  1. Move all inventory files (qa.yml, production.yml...) from `infrastructure/server-setup` to `infrastructure/server-setup/inventory`
  2. Run environment creator for your backup server `yarn environment:init --environment=backup`

- Copy: All application copy is now located in src/translations as CSV files. This is so that copy would be easily editable in software like Excel and Google Sheets. After this change, `AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES_SELECT` doesn't need to be defined anymore by country config.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/compare/v1.3.3...v1.4.0)

- Added examples for configuring HTTP-01, DNS-01, and manual HTTPS certificates. By default, development and QA environments use HTTP-01, while others use DNS-01.
- All secrets & variables defined in Github Secrets are now passed automatically to the deployment script.
- The VPN_HOST_ADDRESS variable is now required for staging and production installations to ensure deployments are not publicly accessible.
- Replica limits have been removed; any number can now be deployed.
- Each environment now has a dedicated docker-compose-<environment>-deploy.yml. Use `environment:init` to create a new environment and generate a corresponding file for customizable configurations.
- ðŸ”’ OpenHIM console is no longer exposed via HTTP.
- Ansible playbooks are refactored into smaller task files.
- Resolved the issue of National ID validation to prevent the informant, father, and mother from having the same ID.

### New features

- We now recommend creating a new Ubuntu user `provision` with passwordless sudo rights for all automated operations on the server, instead of using the root user. New users for different operations will be created in future releases.
- All human users on all servers now have their own Linux users with mandatory 2-factor authentication.
- OpenCRVS Farajaland now has an interactive script `environment:init` for creating new Github environments and defining secrets. This script should also be run for existing environments to ensure all variables and secrets are defined, especially important when pulling the latest changes from the Farajaland repository to your own country resource package.
- The environment creator script also manages the known hosts file automatically.
- ðŸš° New pipeline for automatic provisioning of Ubuntu servers (all environments).
- ðŸš° New pipeline for resetting data from an environment (non-production environments).
- ðŸš° New pipeline for resetting SSH 2FA for all environments.
- ðŸš° Development deploy pipeline now includes a "debug" option for SSHing into the action runner (non-production environments).
- A new "staging" environment has been introduced, acting as a production environment clone that resets its data nightly to match the production environment.
- The deployment script can now verify if there are undefined environment variables referred to in your compose files. All secrets and variables defined in Github Environments are automatically passed down to the deployment script.
- ðŸ”’ Backup archives are now secured with a passphrase.
- HTTPS setup now offers three options: HTTP challenge, DNS challenge, and using a pre-issued certificate file.
- There's now a generic purpose POST /email endpoint only available from the internal network. Elastalert2 is configured to use this endpoint instead of directly using SMTP details or the Sendgrid API key.
- ðŸ”’ QA environment now hosts a Wireguard server and admin panel (wg-easy). After deploying, you can access the admin panel at vpn.<your domain>.
- Allow configuring additional SSH parameters globally using `SSH_ARGS` Github variable.

### Breaking changes

- Known hosts are now defined in the `infrastructure/known-hosts` file. You can clear the file and use `bash infrastructure/environments/update-known-hosts.sh <domain>` to add your own domains.
- Ansible inventory files are now in .yml format. Please convert your old `production.ini` and similar files to this new format.
- The `authorized_keys` file has been removed, and keys should now be defined in the inventory yaml files.
- The `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secret has been replaced with `DOCKER_TOKEN`.

### Note

In the next OpenCRVS release v1.5.0, there will be two significant changes:

- The `infrastructure` directory and related pipelines will be moved to a new repository.
- Both the new infrastructure repository and the OpenCRVS country resource package repositories will start following their own release cycles, mostly independent from the core's release cycle. From this release forward, both packages are released as "OpenCRVS minor compatible" releases, meaning that the OpenCRVS countryconfig 1.3.0-<incrementing release number> is compatible with OpenCRVS 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc. This allows for the release of new hotfix versions of the core without having to publish a new version of the infrastructure or countryconfig.

## [1.3.4](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/compare/v1.3.3...v1.3.4)

### Bug fixes

- Fix typo in certificate handlebar names

## [1.3.3](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3)

### Breaking changes

### New features

- #### Greater customizability of location data in certificates

  The various admin level handlebars e.g. **statePlaceofbirth**,
  **districtPrimaryMother** only contained the name of that location which was
  not able to take advantage of all the information OpenCRVS had available
  about the various admin levels e.g. the name of that location in the
  secondary language. So we are introducing a new set of admin level
  handlebars that would contain the **id** of that location which we can
  resolve into a value of the shape

  ```
  {
    name: string
    alias: string
  }
  ```

  using the new **"location"** handlebar helper. Here name is the primary
  label of the location and alias being the secondary one. Currently only
  these 2 fields are available but we will be adding more fields depending on
  various countries requirements. If previously the certificate svg used to
  contain `{{districtPlaceofbirth}}` then now we can replace it with
  `{{location districtPlaceofbirthId 'name'}}`. To access alias, the `'name'`
  needs to be replaced with `'alias'`.

  Below is a list of all the new handlebars that are meant to be used with the
  "location" handlebar helper.

  - statePrimaryInformantId
  - districtPrimaryInformantId
  - statePlaceofbirthId
  - districtPlaceofbirthId
  - statePrimaryMotherId
  - districtPrimaryMotherId
  - statePrimaryFatherId
  - districtPrimaryFatherId
  - statePrimaryDeceasedId
  - districtPrimaryDeceasedId
  - statePlaceofdeathId
  - districtPlaceofdeathId
  - statePrimaryGroomId
  - districtPrimaryGroomId
  - statePrimaryBrideId
  - districtPrimaryBrideId
  - statePlaceofmarriageId
  - districtPlaceofmarriageId
  - registrar.stateId
  - registrar.districtId
  - registrar.officeId
  - registrationAgent.stateId
  - registrationAgent.districtId
  - registrationAgent.officeId

  ##### We will be deprecating the counterpart of the above mentioned handlebars that contains only the label of the specified location in a future version so we highly recommend that implementers update their certificates to use these new ones.

- #### "Spouse" section in Farajaland death form

  Spouse section is an optional section in death form. Going forward it will be included in Farajaland example configuration.

- #### Type of ID dropdown
  Farajaland forms will now include a dropdown to select the type of ID an individual is providing e.g. National ID, Driving License etc. instead of being restricted to only national ID number.
- #### Number of dependents of deceased field
  As an example of custom field, the deceased section in death form will now include the **numberOfDependants** field.
- #### Reason for late registration field
  The birth & death forms will include another custom field, **reasonForLateRegistration**, which makes use of "LATE_REGISTRATION_TARGET" configuration option in it's visibility conditional.

### Bug fixes

- Updated translations for form introduction page and sending for approval to reflect the default notification method being email.
- Remove hard-coded conditionals from "occupation" field to make it usable in the deceased form

See [Releases](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/releases) for release notes of older releases.
