# Changelog

## 1.7.0 Release candidate

### Migration notes
In order to make the upgrade easier, there are a couple of steps that need to be performed which will make the codebase ready for the upgrade:
- Run this command from the root of the countryconfig repository ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/configurable-roles/src/upgrade-to-1_7.ts | npx ts-node -T --cwd ./src```

  It will remove `roles.csv` and generate a `roles.ts` file. It will also update the corresponding role column in `default-employees.csv` & `prod-employees.csv` while adding the corresponding translations in `client.csv`. The employee files are only used when seeding new environments, if you already have a v1.6.x of OpenCRVS deployed, the data in the environment will automatically get migrated after deploying the upgrade. The changes in these two files are made to keep the roles in sync with your previously deployed environments, if any.
- After pulling in the v1.7.0 changes reject the changes incoming to `roles.ts`, `default-employees.csv` & `prod-employees.csv` files as we used the script above to auto-generate them.

  The `roles.ts` file now defines all the roles available in the system. New roles can be added & existing roles can be customized by giving them different scopes.

  *N.B. The default roles generated in the `roles.ts` file during migration should not be removed to maintain backwards compatibility*

### Breaking changes

- `INFORMANT_SIGNATURE` & `INFORMANT_SIGNATURE_REQUIRED` are now deprecated
- Existing implementations relying on database-stored SVGs need to be updated to use the new configuration-based approach. A migration needs to be run (defined in [migration](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/pull/7813/files#diff-e5472dec87399bb9f73f75ec379ceb6a32ca135bc01dd8d0eb8f7d7aaa0bc0b1)), and default certificate templates must be created for each event type, following the convention `${event}-certificate` as the certificate template ID.
- **Roles** The previous `roles.csv` file has been deprecated. It will get removed once you run `yarn upgrade:code` command after pulling in the v1.7 changes. The command automatically generates a `roles.json` file which can be used as a baseline to configure the roles as per your requirements.
- **Github runners upgraded** to latest Ubuntu LTS release 24.04 [#7045](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7045) and apply sticky node version from .nvmrc [#423](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/423)

### New features

- Update the translations for System user add/edit form, `Last name` to `User's surname` and `First name` to `User's first name` to make them less confusing for system users [#6830](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6830)
- **User scopes** Introduce granular scopes to grant specific permissions to a particular role. The specifics about the introduced scopes can be found here: *Link to scopes description file*
- **Refactored certificate handling:** SVGs are no longer stored in the database; streamlined configurations now include certificate details, and clients request SVGs directly via URLs.
- Add constant.humanName to allow countries to customise the format of the full name in the system for `system users` and `citizens` e.g `{LastName} {MiddleName} {Firstname}`, in any case where one of the name is not provided e.g no `MiddleName`, we'll simply render e.g `{LastName} {FirstName}` without any extra spaces if that's the order set in `country-config`. [#6830](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6830)

### Improvements

- Auth token, ip address, remote address, mobile number, email redacted/masked from server log
- Optimized deployment times by making docker images download in parallel.
- Country alpha3 ISO code now is derived from variables to the Docker Compose files and don't need to be hard coded

### Bug fixes

- Protect individual certificate endpoint with token
- Kibana disk space alerts now work regardless of your disk device names. Alerts listen devices mounted both to `/` and `/data` (encrypted data partition)
- "Publish release" pipeline now correctly uses the "Branch to build from" value as the branch to be tagged. Previously it tried tagging "master". "Release tag" is also now used as the release version as is instead of it being read from `package.json`.
- Backup process now doesn't require internet connection to download docker images thus working more reliably when internet connections are unreliable. Previously non-active images were cleaned nightly, now we only do it as part of deployment. [#7896](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7896)
- We make sure that the automatic cleanup job only runs before deployment (instead of cron schedule cleanup).
- Previously it was possible MongoDB replica set and users were left randomly uninitialised after a deployment. MongoDB initialisation container now retries on failure.
- On some machines 'file' utility was not preinstalled causing provision to fail. We now install the utility if it doesn't exist.
- Restrict supported key exchange, cipher and MAC algorithms for SSH configuration [#7542](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/7542)

- On some machines 'file' utility was not preinstalled causing provision to fail. We now install the utility if it doesn't exist.

## 1.6.0

### Breaking changes

- **Notification Flags** The configuration of various notifications is now controlled from `countryconfig` instead of being handled in the UI, as notification settings are not something that should be changed on the fly. To simplify this process, we have moved the settings to the `application-config.ts` file. From now on, the notifications can be managed in the `notificationForRecord` object defined in the mentioned file. Any changes will take effect after a new deployment.

  **_Country implementors must define the `notificationForRecord` object in the `application-config.ts` file to enable the notifications they want. Not doing so will keep notifications disabled by default._**

- **Gateways searchEvents API updated** `operationHistories` only returns `operationType` & `operatedOn` due to the other fields being unused in OpenCRVS
- **Config changes to review/preview and signatures** Core used to provide review/preview section by default which are now removed and need to be provided from countryconfig. The signature field definitions (e.g. informant signature, bride signature etc.) were hard coded in core which also have now been removed. The signatures can now be added through the review/preview sections defined in countryconfig just like any other field. You can use the following section definition as the default which is without any additional fields. We highly recommend checking out our reference country repository which has the signature fields in it's review/preview sections

```
{
  id: 'preview',
  viewType: 'preview',
  name: {
    defaultMessage: 'Preview',
    description: 'Form section name for Preview',
    id: 'register.form.section.preview.name'
  },
  title: {
    defaultMessage: 'Preview',
    description: 'Form section title for Preview',
    id: 'register.form.section.preview.title'
  },
  groups: [
    {
      id: 'preview-view-group',
      fields: []
    }
  ]
}
```

- Remove `splitView` option from DOCUMENT_UPLOADER_WITH_OPTION field
- New required sections preview & review added. Signature field definitions are now part of these two sections same as normal form fields.
- Remove `inputFieldWidth` from Number type form field
- Application config file is renamed to `application-config.ts`
- Allow configuring the default search criteria for record search which can be done by adding or modifying a property named `SEARCH_DEFAULT_CRITERIA` in `application-config.ts`
  Value of `SEARCH_DEFAULT_CRITERIA` can be one of the following
  1. 'TRACKING_ID',
  2. 'REGISTRATION_NUMBER',
  3. 'NATIONAL_ID',
  4. 'NAME',
  5. 'PHONE_NUMBER',
  6. 'EMAIL'
- Updated `allowedFileFormats` in signature fields to use MIME types (`image/png`, `image/jpg`, `image/jpeg`, `image/svg`) instead of simple file extensions. If you are already using the `allowedFileFormats` field in your implementation, please ensure to update the format accordingly.
- The details exists conditionals for the various sections i.e. father, mother, spouse has to use the `values.detailsExist` property instead of accessing it from `draftData.[sectionName].detailsExists`. This is due to the fact that the draftData is not populated until any changes have been made to any of the fields in the current section.

### New features

- Certificate handlebar for registration fees `registrationFees` [#6817](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6817)
- Logged in user details handlebar `loggedInUser` [#6529](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/6529)
- Supporting document fields can now be made required
- If there is only one option in the document uploader select, then it stays hidden and only the upload button is showed with the only option being selected by default
- The select options in DOCUMENT_UPLOADER_WITH_OPTION field can now be hidden using the new `optionCondition` property. It works similarly to the same property available in SELECT_WITH_OPTIONS field

* **ElasticSearch reindexing** Allows reindexing ElasticSearch via a new search-service endpoint `reindex`. We're replacing the original `ocrvs` index with timestamped ones. This is done automatically when upgrading and migrating, but this is an important architectural change that should be noted. More details in [#7033](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/pull/7033).

- Introduce a new certificate handlebar "preview" which can be used to conditionally render some svg element when previewing the certificate e.g. background image similar to security paper

- **Notification flags**: Added notification flags for `BIRTH`, `DEATH`, and `MARRIAGE` events, including:

  - `sent-notification`
  - `sent-notification-for-review`
  - `sent-for-approval`
  - `registered`
  - `sent-for-updates`

- **`/record-notification` API**: Endpoint to check enabled notifications for records. The API returns the `notificationForRecord` object for `BIRTH` and `DEATH` events, listing their respective flags. Route configuration includes description and tags for API documentation.

## Bug fixes

- Github pipeline dedicated for reading secrets and variables from other environments now checks if GH_TOKEN is still valid before attempting other operations
- Remove unnecessary UI dividers that add in various sections of the declaration forms(e.g the Death, Birth and Marriage forms) [#244](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/244)
- Update template transformer for fields `informantType` and `otherInformantType` that fixes the bug of unavailability of these template fields [#5952](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/5952)
- Fixed missing InitialValue property to set initial values based on an expression

## 1.5.2 (https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.5.1...v1.5.2)

## Bug fixes

- Broken email alerts from low disk space are now fixed [293](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/293)

## 1.5.0 (https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.4.1...v1.5.0)

### Breaking changes

- **Removed dependency on OpenHIM.**&#x20;

  The performance of OpenHIM added an unexpected burden of 200 m/s to every interaction. Cumulatively, this was negatively affecting user experience and therefore we decided to deprecate it.&#x20;

  &#x20;Interested implementers are free to re-introduce OpenHIM should they wish to use it as an interoperability layer without affecting the performance of OpenCRVS now that our architecture no longer depends on it.

  The OpenHIM database is kept for backwards compatibility reasons and will be removed in v1.6. [OpenHIM](https://openhim.org/) is an Open Source middleware component designed for managing FHIR interoperability between disparate systems as part of the OpenHIE architectural specification. We had been using this component in a much more fundamental way to monitor microservice comms in a similar fashion to Amazon SQS. &#x20;

- **Upgrade node version to 18**

  This version enforces environment to have Node 18 installed (supported until April 2025) and removes support for Node 16

  - Use nvm to upgrade your local development environment to use node version `18.19.x.`
  - Specified operating systems in js modules as `darwin, linux`
  - Dev scripts and Vite run with an environment variable `NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first` to resolve ipv4 addresses for `localhost` to support systems that resolves ipv6 addresses by default in Node versions >=17

- **Update the certificate preview mechanism** In effort of minimizing JavaScript-bundle size, we have streamlined the way how review certificate -page renders certificates. In case the images in your certificates are previewing blurry, you need to update your SVG-certificates to print QR-codes and other images directly with `<image width="36" height="36" xlink:href="{{qrCode}}" x="500" y="770"></image>` instead of the more complicated `<rect fill="url(#pattern)"></rect>` -paradigm. This doesn't affect printed certificates as they are still created as previously.
- **Generate default address according to logged-in user's location** We have dropped support for the 'agentDefault' prop which was used as initial value for SELECT_WITH_DYNAMIC_OPTIONS fields. If you have not made any changes to address generation, then this should not affect you. If you have, you can refer to this PR to see how agentDefault has been deprecated in an example country: [https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/pull/978](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-farajaland/pull/978)
- **Remove system admin UI items: Application, User roles** We have now moved to configuring these items away from the UI in favour of directly editing these from country configuration repository in code - specifically in application-config-default.ts.
- **Set Metabase default credentials.** These must be configured via countryconfig repository environment variables and secrets otherwise the dashboard service won't start
- **Check your Metabase map file.** For Metabase configuration, we renamed `farajaland-map.geojson` to `map.geojson` to not tie implementations into example country naming conventions.
- **Feature flags** In order to make application config settings more readable, we re-organised `src/api/application/application-config-default.ts` with a clear feature flag block like so. These are then used across the front and back end of the application to control configurable functionality. New feature flags DEATH_REGISTRATION allow you to optionally run off death registration if your country doesnt want to run its first pilot including death and PRINT_DECLARATION (see New Features) have been added.
  `FEATURES: {
  DEATH_REGISTRATION: true,
  MARRIAGE_REGISTRATION: false,
  ...
} `
- **Improve rendering of addresses in review page where addresses match** When entering father's address details, some countries make use of a checkbox which says "Address is the same as the mothers. " which, when selected, makes the mother's address and fathers address the same. The checkbox has a programatic value of "Yes" or "No". As a result on the review page, the value "Yes" was displayed which didn't make grammatical sense as a response. We decided to use a custom label: "Same as mother's", which is what was asked on the form. This requires some code changes in the src/form/addresses/index.ts file to pull in the `hideInPreview` prop which will hide the value "Yes" on the review page and replace with a content managed label. Associated bug [#5086](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-core/issues/5086)

### Infrastructure breaking changes

More improvements have been made to the infrastructure provisioning and Github environment creation scripts and documentation. The complexity is somewhat reduced.

- **We removed the example Wireguard VPN set up as it was confusing.** Our intention was to ensure that all implementers were aware that OpenCRVS should be installed behind a VPN and used Wireguard as an example. But the configuration requirements for Wireguard confused implementers who are not using it. Therefore we decided to remove Wireguard as an example. &#x20;
- **We now have a "backup" Github environment and the backup server is automatically provisioned.** We moved the inventory file location to an explicit directory and removed parameters to scripts that can be automated. To migrate, move all inventory files (qa.yml, production.yml, staging.yml from `infrastructure/server-setup` to `infrastructure/server-setup/inventory` and configure `infrastructure/server-setup/inventory/backup.yml`. Run environment creator for your backup server `yarn environment:init --environment=backup`
- **You can configure the file path on the backup server where backups are stored.** We can also allow using staging to both periodically restore a production backup and also give it the capability if required to backup it's own data to a different location using `backup_server_remote_target_directory` and `backup_server_remote_source_directory` Ansible variables. This use case is mostly meant for OpenCRVS team internal use.
- **We now automate SSH key exchange between application and backup server.** For staging servers, automatically fetch production backup encryption key if periodic restore is enabled using `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` Ansible variables. Therefore documentation is simplified for a new server set-up.
- **In infrastructure Github workflows: SSH_PORT is new and required allowing you the ability to use a non-standard SSH port.** This Github Action environment variable must be added.
- **In infrastructure Github workflows: SSH_HOST** should be moved from being a Github Action environment secret to a Github Action environment variable before it is deprecated in 1.7.0
- **No longer an assumption made that production server Docker replicas and Mongo replica-sets are necessary.** In our Docker Compose files, we had originally assumed that a production deployment would always be deployed on a cluster to enable load balancing. We applied a [Mongo replica set](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/48cf278bab9d17e07b60b427294a26c8f35bcc1b/infrastructure/docker-compose.production-deploy.yml#L170C3-L201C19) by default on production and set [replicas: 2](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/blob/48cf278bab9d17e07b60b427294a26c8f35bcc1b/infrastructure/docker-compose.production-deploy.yml#L124) on each microservice. However after experience in multiple countries running small scale pilots, a production deployment usually starts off as 1 server node and then scales into a cluster over time in order to save costs and resources. Therefore these replicas are a waste of resources. So you will notice that this has been deleted. You can always manually add your desired replicas back into you Docker Compose configuration if you want. In Docker Compose files, search for REPLICAS and update accordingly as well as attending to the linked examples.

Follow the descriptions in the migration notes to re-provision all servers safely.

### New features

- Introduced rate limiting to routes that could potentially be bruteforced or extracted PII from.
- The login and client application loading experience has improved. A loading bar appears before the javaScript bundle has loaded and this transitions when fetching records.&#x20;
- Development time logs are now much tidier and errors easier to point out. Production logging will still remain as is.&#x20;
- Masked emails and phone numbers from notification logs.
- Support for landscape certificate templates.
- Allow defining maxLength attribute for number type fields.
- A new certificate handlebar for registration fees has been added `registrationFees`
- A new certificate handlebar for logged-in user details has been added `loggedInUser`&#x20;
- Add support for image compression configuration. Two new properties to this form field are available: `DOCUMENT_UPLOADER_WITH_OPTION`
  - `compressImagesToSizeMB` : An optional prop of number type to define a compressed size. Compression is ignored when the input file is already smaller or equal of the given value or a falsy given value.
  - `maxSizeMB`: An optional validation prop to prevent input of a file bigger than a defined value.
- If a country doesnt wish to use Sentry for logging errors, the SENTRY_DSN variable is now optional and the LogRocket option has been deprecated due to lack of demand.
- Given that upon an upgrade between versions of OpenCRVS, that users cache is cleared, it is important to inform staff to submit any draft applications before the upgrade date. We introduced an "Email all users" feature so that National System Admins can send all staff messages. This feature can be used for any other all staff comms that are deemed required.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-06-25 at 17.12.54.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

- Included an endpoint for serving individual certificates in development mode. This improves the developer experience when configuring certificates.
- Removed logrocket refrences.
- Enable gzip compression in client & login
- Use docker compose v2 in github workflows
- Added SMTP environment variables into the qa compose file to enable QA of SMTP servers.
- In the certificate, the 'Place of Certification' now accurately reflects the correct location.
- Groom's and Bride's name, printIssue translation variables updated [#124](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/pull/124)
- Add query mapper for International Postal Code field
- Provide env variables for metabase admin credentials
- Improved formatting of informant name for inProgress declaration emails
- There is now an option to print the review page of an event declaration form. The PRINT_DECLARATION feature flag in application config settings can enable this on or off.

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1)

- Improved logging for emails being sent
- Updated default Metabase init file so that it's compatible with the current Metabase version
- Deployment: Verifies Kibana is ready before setting up alert configuration
- Deployment: Removes `depends_on` configuration from docker compose files
- Deployment: Removes some deprecated deployment code around Elastalert config file formatting
- Provisioning: Creates backup user on backup servers automatically
- Provisioning: Update ansible Github action task version

- Copy: All application copy is now located in src/translations as CSV files. This is so that copy would be easily editable in software like Excel and Google Sheets. After this change, `AVAILABLE_LANGUAGES_SELECT` doesn't need to be defined anymore by country config.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.3.3...v1.4.0)

- Added examples for configuring HTTP-01, DNS-01, and manual HTTPS certificates. By default, development and QA environments use HTTP-01, while others use DNS-01.
- All secrets & variables defined in Github Secrets are now passed automatically to the deployment script.
- The VPN_HOST_ADDRESS variable is now required for staging and production installations to ensure deployments are not publicly accessible.
- Replica limits have been removed; any number can now be deployed.
- Each environment now has a dedicated docker-compose-<environment>-deploy.yml. Use `environment:init` to create a new environment and generate a corresponding file for customizable configurations.
- 🔒 OpenHIM console is no longer exposed via HTTP.
- Ansible playbooks are refactored into smaller task files.

### New features

- We now recommend creating a new Ubuntu user `provision` with passwordless sudo rights for all automated operations on the server, instead of using the root user. New users for different operations will be created in future releases.
- All human users on all servers now have their own Linux users with mandatory 2-factor authentication.
- OpenCRVS Farajaland now has an interactive script `environment:init` for creating new Github environments and defining secrets. This script should also be run for existing environments to ensure all variables and secrets are defined, especially important when pulling the latest changes from the Farajaland repository to your own country resource package.
- The environment creator script also manages the known hosts file automatically.
- 🚰 New pipeline for automatic provisioning of Ubuntu servers (all environments).
- 🚰 New pipeline for resetting data from an environment (non-production environments).
- 🚰 New pipeline for resetting SSH 2FA for all environments.
- 🚰 Development deploy pipeline now includes a "debug" option for SSHing into the action runner (non-production environments).
- A new "staging" environment has been introduced, acting as a production environment clone that resets its data nightly to match the production environment.
- The deployment script can now verify if there are undefined environment variables referred to in your compose files. All secrets and variables defined in Github Environments are automatically passed down to the deployment script.
- 🔒 Backup archives are now secured with a passphrase.
- HTTPS setup now offers three options: HTTP challenge, DNS challenge, and using a pre-issued certificate file.
- There's now a generic purpose POST /email endpoint only available from the internal network. Elastalert2 is configured to use this endpoint instead of directly using SMTP details or the Sendgrid API key.
- 🔒 QA environment now hosts a Wireguard server and admin panel (wg-easy). After deploying, you can access the admin panel at vpn.<your domain>.
- Allow configuring additional SSH parameters globally using `SSH_ARGS` Github variable.

### Breaking changes

- Known hosts are now defined in the `infrastructure/known-hosts` file. You can clear the file and use `bash infrastructure/environments/update-known-hosts.sh <domain>` to add your own domains.
- Ansible inventory files are now in .yml format. Please convert your old `production.ini` and similar files to this new format.
- The `authorized_keys` file has been removed, and keys should now be defined in the inventory yaml files.
- The `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secret has been replaced with `DOCKER_TOKEN`.

### Note

In the next OpenCRVS release v1.5.0, there will be two significant changes:

- The `infrastructure` directory and related pipelines will be moved to a new repository.
- Both the new infrastructure repository and the OpenCRVS country resource package repositories will start following their own release cycles, mostly independent from the core's release cycle. From this release forward, both packages are released as "OpenCRVS minor compatible" releases, meaning that the OpenCRVS countryconfig 1.3.0-<incrementing release number> is compatible with OpenCRVS 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.2, etc. This allows for the release of new hotfix versions of the core without having to publish a new version of the infrastructure or countryconfig.

## [1.3.4](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.3.3...v1.3.4)

### Bug fixes

- Fix typo in certificate handlebar names

## [1.3.3](https://github.com/opencrvs/opencrvs-countryconfig/compare/v1.3.2...v1.3.3)

### New features

- #### Greater customizability of location data in certificates

  The various admin level handlebars e.g. **statePlaceofbirth**,
  **districtPrimaryMother** only contained the name of that location which was
  not able to take advantage of all the information OpenCRVS had available
  about the various admin levels e.g. the name of that location in the
  secondary language. So we are introducing a new set of admin level
  handlebars that would contain the **id** of that location which we can
  resolve into a value of the shape

  ```
  {
    name: string
    alias: string
  }
  ```

  using the new **"location"** handlebar helper. Here name is the primary
  label of the location and alias being the secondary one. Currently only
  these 2 fields are available but we will be adding more fields depending on
  various countries requirements. If previously the certificate svg used to
  contain `{{districtPlaceofbirth}}` then now we can replace it with
  `{{location districtPlaceofbirthId 'name'}}`. To access alias, the `'name'`
  needs to be replaced with `'alias'`.

  Below is a list of all the new handlebars that are meant to be used with the
  "location" handlebar helper.

  - statePrimaryInformantId
  - districtPrimaryInformantId
  - statePlaceofbirthId
  - districtPlaceofbirthId
  - statePrimaryMotherId
  - districtPrimaryMotherId
  - statePrimaryFatherId
  - districtPrimaryFatherId
  - statePrimaryDeceasedId
  - districtPrimaryDeceasedId
  - statePlaceofdeathId
  - districtPlaceofdeathId
  - statePrimaryGroomId
  - districtPrimaryGroomId
  - statePrimaryBrideId
  - districtPrimaryBrideId
  - statePlaceofmarriageId
  - districtPlaceofmarriageId
  - registrar.stateId
  - registrar.districtId
  - registrar.officeId
  - registrationAgent.stateId
  - registrationAgent.districtId
  - registrationAgent.officeId

  ##### We will be deprecating the counterpart of the above mentioned handlebars that contains only the label of the specified location in a future version so we highly recommend that implementers update their certificates to use these new ones.

- #### "Spouse" section in Farajaland death form

  Spouse section is an optional section in death form. Going forward it will be included in Farajaland example configuration.

- #### Type of ID dropdown
  Farajaland forms will now include a dropdown to select the type of ID an individual is providing e.g. National ID, Driving License etc. instead of being restricted to only national ID number.
- #### Number of dependents of deceased field
  As an example of custom field, the deceased section in death form will now include the **numberOfDependants** field.
- #### Reason for late registration field
  The birth & death forms will include another custom field, **reasonForLateRegistration**, which makes use of "LATE_REGISTRATION_TARGET" configuration option in it's visibility conditional.

### Bug fixes

- Updated translations for form introduction page and sending for approval to reflect the default notification method being email.
- Remove hard-coded conditionals from "occupation" field to make it usable in the deceased form
